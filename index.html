            <p><b>Creative Director:</b> Anthony Vaccarello</p>
            <p><b>Best Known for:</b> Brought art to fashion. Popularization of women's trousers for all occasions. Brought diversity on the runaway.</p>
            <p><b>About:</b> One word to describe Saint Laurent would be “bold”. In many ways, Saint Laurent was ahead of his times. In an era when it was unthinkable for women to wear men’s suits, he introduced the Le Smoking suit. In keeping with the new wave of feminism in the 60s, Yves Saint Laurent introduced tops constructed using see-through fabric that revealed women’s breasts. It was a risque move, but this collection spoke highly of how the designer put the woman first in his designs.</p></p>
